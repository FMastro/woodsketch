# Backlog

Things we deliberately skipped or know are incomplete, to come back to. Newest first within
each section. Remove items when they're done (mention them in the commit).

## Next up (recommended order, 2026-10-17)
1. **Agent-ready** (Woodworking direction, item 8): a project recipe (JSON), a command line
   (`woodsketch build`, `cutlist`, `cutsheet`, `render`), an MCP server so Claude and other
   assistants can design with WoodSketch, and docs for agents. Templates (with their drawers, doors and
   hardware) are the building blocks a recipe calls.
2. **SketchUp import, more of it** (started: SketchUp 2021+ files open and import; see SketchUp
   files below for what's missing). Next: more sample files from different versions, then groups,
   hidden edges and SketchUp 2020 and older.
3. **Release polish** (installers, auto-update, icons and the site's download links are done):
   - Signing: Windows with Azure Artifact Signing (~$9.99/month; individuals in the US/Canada; a
     paid Azure subscription; identity validation takes days; CI signs via OIDC, no stored key).
     macOS with an Apple Developer ID ($99/year) plus notarization, or Gatekeeper blocks it.
     Linux needs none (optionally GPG-signed checksums). Until then SmartScreen and Gatekeeper
     warn. Do it before announcing WoodSketch widely.
   - `.woodsketch` file association on all three (double-click opens it).
   - Windows ARM64 and Linux ARM64 builds; a macOS DMG; Linux .deb/.rpm; SHA-256 checksums.
   - Delta updates (download the previous release before packing, so updates are small).
   - A Download button on woodsketch.net that picks the visitor's OS.

## Woodworking direction (in this order)
SketchUp-familiar modeling, specialized for woodworking: parts know they're wood. Keep general
modeling (rooms, jigs, odd shapes) working; the wood features add on and stay optional.
1. **Parts that know they're wood** (done: grain direction and cut per part, a part section in
   Entity Info, a grain arrow, and the joints and profiles made on a part listed with it). Still
   to come: picking the reference face/edge on the model (for build sheets).
2. **Board from stock** (done). Later: choose which side of the line a lumber board's width goes
   (it's always to the left of the drag now), Tab to cycle a board's faces against a surface, and
   picking stock straight from the Materials panel.
3. **Joinery** (done: dado, groove and rabbet let in from a butt joint, mortise and tenon
   (through, haunched), dovetails (through, half-blind), dowels, biscuits, loose tenons, splines,
   pocket screws (pockets drawn on the hidden face, not the angled bore), box joint, half-lap,
   cut where parts overlap; reinforced glue-up seams; a hardware list; Change and Remove on
   each joint, starting from its sizes; a fit allowance on mortises and dowel holes). Still to come:
   a fit allowance on slots, haunched tenons and angled joints; sliding and lapped dovetails,
   variable dovetail spacing; joints made before sizes were kept start from suggestions; joints
   can't be removed after a part is changed by hand (use Undo); parts in
   different groups (both must be side by side now).
4. **Edge profiles** (done: roundover, chamfer, cove, ogee, around a face with mitered corners or
   along a length, from the Edge profile panel). Still to come: bead and other bits; profiling a
   board that already has joints or other cuts (profile first for now); edges around a face and
   along the length on one board; clicking edges in the model to pick them; changing a profile
   later (it's listed, not yet parametric); curved and angled edges.
5. **Build sheets** (done: a printable page per part from the Cut List window, with its size,
   stock, three dimensioned views to scale, and steps in shop order). Still to come: where each
   joint and profile sits (dimensions to it from the reference face and edge, which aren't picked
   yet), hidden lines dashed, an exploded assembly view and glue-up order.
6. **Wood movement checks** (done: Wood Handbook coefficients per species and cut, a moisture swing
   setting, how much each part moves, and warnings where touching parts fight it, in the Cut List
   window). Still to come: arrows and numbers on the model; telling a floating panel or slotted
   fastening from a glued one (every touching cross-grain meeting is flagged now); species data
   for custom woods (only names matching a known species get it); movement in thickness and
   along the grain; parts at an angle (only parts square to the axes are checked).
7. **Templates** (done: cabinet with drawers and doors in its openings, drawer, face frame, table,
   each changeable in size; hardware as parts). Still to come: more templates (bookcase with
   adjustable shelves, bed, workbench); see Templates and Drawers, doors and hardware below.
8. **Agent-ready**: let AI agents design with WoodSketch, so a woodworker can ask their assistant
   "build me a nightstand, 24\" tall, from 3/4\" cherry" and get a real drawing, cut list,
   cutting diagrams and shopping list. The engine (`doc`) already runs without the UI. Pieces:
   - A project recipe (JSON): parts as boards from stock (material, section or thickness, length,
     place, orientation), joints between them, tags; validated with clear errors an agent can fix
     ("Shelf doesn't touch Side"). Builds a `.woodsketch`.
   - A command line: `woodsketch build recipe.json`, `cutlist`, `cutsheet` (HTML), `export`,
     `render` (PNG views), headless.
   - An MCP server (`woodsketch mcp`) so Claude and other agents can call it directly: add boards,
     make joints, read the cut list and diagrams, render views to check their work.
   - Docs for agents (an AGENTS.md / llms.txt on woodsketch.net with recipes for common
     furniture), and the app opening what an agent made for editing by hand.
9. Later: a community model library (a separate service: accounts, moderation, licensing;
   3D Warehouse's terms forbid aggregating its models), cost estimates (board feet / sheets x
   price), exploded views and assembly order.

## Templates
- Change size rebuilds from scratch, so edits made inside the group by hand are lost (the button's
  tooltip warns).
- Still fixed: 1/4" plywood backs, drawer bottoms and door panels, 3/4" fronts and doors, 3/4"
  aprons; a cabinet's drawer boxes are 1/2".
- Cabinet: shelves are evenly spaced (adjustable ones sit on pins at those heights; the rows of
  pin holes aren't drilled in the sides); the back is applied over the back edges, not set in a
  rabbet; no face frame, toe kick or dividers.
- Drawer: a box only (no applied false front); the bottom's corners aren't notched around the
  corner joints.
- Face frame: no mullions (upright dividers) yet.
- Table: the tenon's size follows the leg (not set by hand); no stretchers or drawer.
- A new template goes a foot to the right of everything, not where you click.

## Angled joints
- Parts must share one axis (turned to each other about their thickness, say): no compound angles,
  and a part already cut at an angle in another plane (a post with a mortise for a brace leaning
  the other way) can't take another angled joint.
- Only mortise and tenon and housings at an angle: no angled dowels, half-laps or dovetails. The
  tenon goes as deep as the overlap drawn; no fit allowance.
- A joint on one copy of a shared component makes that copy its own component (the others, maybe
  mirrored, stay as they were); square joints change every copy.
- The rebuilt parts lose paint on single faces, and keep a stray corner where faces were merged.

## Drawers, doors and hardware
- Only in the Cabinet template's openings: no clicking an opening in a hand-drawn cabinet, and no
  face-frame cabinets (fronts set in a face frame) yet.
- Side-mount slides only (1/2" a side, the longest standard length that fits); no undermount
  slides or choosing a slide and its clearances.
- Hinges are plain boxes (no cup bored in the door, no mounting plates), and there's one hinge
  kind (concealed); pairs of doors always hinge at the outsides. Pulls are 5" bars or knobs,
  centered (two on a drawer front over 24"), not placed or sized by hand.
- Frame-and-panel doors have a 1/4" plywood panel; no solid (raised) panels sized for wood
  movement yet.
- No screws, and no way to place hardware on parts drawn by hand; no hardware prices.

## Copy and paste
- Guides aren't copied.
- The copy stays inside one running WoodSketch: the system clipboard only gets a note, so it can't
  be pasted into a second copy of WoodSketch or another app.
- Paste is carried by its box's lowest corner; no picking a different grab point.
- Pasted loose geometry doesn't merge with geometry it lands on (see Auto-joining below).
- Duplicate always places 2" to the right; no repeat (Move with Ctrl and `3x` does arrays).

## SketchUp files
- SketchUp 2020 and older files use a different format and are refused with a message (open and
  save them in SketchUp 2021+ first).
- Groups come in as components (the flag that tells them apart isn't worked out yet).
- Not read: textures, hidden and soft edges (edges between faces under 30° still draw soft),
  guides, scenes and cameras, dimensions and text, images, back-face materials, transparency.
- A material named for a species (`cedar`) comes in as solid wood, not that species' lumber, so a
  deck's 2x10s are matched by thickness, not as 2x10 sections (change the type to dimensional
  lumber in the Materials panel).
- Imported materials are solid wood unless the name matches a library wood or a sheet good, so
  their stock may need setting in the Materials panel.
- No saving back to `.skp`.
- Tested on SketchUp 2026 files only so far; more sample files from other versions will turn up
  records that aren't read yet.
- Materials are sorted into wood, sheet goods and Other by their names; a painted wood part (a
  material named like `[Color_009]`) comes in as Other, so set its type in the Materials panel.
- Wanted for testing: a model with groups, one saved by SketchUp 2021 or 2022, and a detailed piece
  of furniture (drawers, joinery).

## Geometry
- **Auto-joining**: moved or copied geometry doesn't merge with geometry it lands on (shared
  vertices/edges aren't welded). Fine while boards should stay separate.
- **Coplanar face merging**: two faces on one plane that share an edge stay separate (a seam
  edge remains, e.g. boards glued end to end). Erasing the seam merges them, and Push/Pull
  merges walls flush with a side, but nothing merges automatically otherwise.
- **Collinear leftovers**: merging faces (erasing a splitting line, pulling part of a top up
  flush with a side) keeps the extra vertex where an edge was split; SketchUp heals those.
- **Move can't bend faces**: SketchUp folds a face that would become non-planar (adds a
  diagonal); we refuse the move instead.

## Scale
- No mirroring (negative factors are refused); no Shift to switch corner grips to non-uniform
  or edge grips to uniform.
- Several things scaled together use the red/green/blue axes; a rotated group among them gets
  sheared, and the cut list then measures it only approximately.
- Grips are drawn like Move's rotation grips (red crosses); SketchUp's are green boxes, and it
  hides the ones facing away.

## Circles and arcs
- Curves aren't one entity: a circle is 24 separate edges (SketchUp groups them, so one click
  selects the whole circle and Entity Info shows its radius and sides).
- Soft edges are worked out when drawing (faces meeting under 30° hide their shared edge);
  there's no per-edge Soften/Smooth setting, and facets are shaded flat, not smoothed.
- Arc: no tangent inference, no 3-point Arc or Pie, no Polygon tool. Circles off any face lie
  flat on the ground plane.

## Offset
- Only a face's outer outline is offset; holes aren't (SketchUp offsets them too).
- Can't offset a selection of connected edges (only faces), and the distance doesn't snap
  to points the cursor passes over.
- Corners are always mitered (sharp); no rounded outward corners.

## Guides (Tape Measure)
- Tape Measure: no "resize the model" after measuring (SketchUp offers to scale everything so
  the measured distance becomes the typed one).
- No Protractor guides (angled guide lines), no "hide guides" toggle (only Delete Guides).
- Guide lines snap where they cross edges and other guides, but not where they cross faces.

## Inference / snapping
- Line: a typed length can't be changed after the line is drawn. Rectangle, Arc and Circle
  don't use parallel/perpendicular or "From Point" inference yet (Line, Move and Tape do).
- Faces closed from loose lines face up, else toward the front, else to the right; SketchUp
  orients them to match connected faces. No Reverse Faces command yet.
- Rectangle: square and golden-ratio diagonal hints; drawing rectangles off the axes.
- Snapping only considers screen distance; no "sticky" preference for the last inference.

## Groups and components
- Deliberate difference from SketchUp: starting Line, Rectangle, Circle, Arc, Push/Pull or
  Offset on a closed group's face opens the group, so the work goes into the board. (Paint
  still paints the whole group, as in SketchUp.)
- Selected groups are tinted; SketchUp instead draws their bounding box in blue.
- No renaming or drag-to-reparent in the Outliner, no "make unique" command for components, no
  component browser (copy and paste or Move with Ctrl place more instances).
- Move stretching doesn't reach into groups from outside (Move moves the whole group).
- Undo snapshots copy every definition; fine now, heavy for big furniture assemblies.
- Copies of a group share a definition until opened (SketchUp's behavior); opening one gives
  it its own copy, which isn't an undo step by itself.

## Cut list
- One sheet size per material (OpenCutList keeps a list of sheet sizes to choose from), and
  no offcuts inventory. Defaults are US sizes.
- Glue-ups: strips are equal widths (no mixing a wide and a narrow board), with a fixed 1/4"
  jointing allowance and 1" trim; edge-glued panels only (no face-glued thick parts like a
  laminated leg); the build sheet doesn't draw the boards.
- No edge banding or veneer.
- Packing is heuristic (several orders and rules, best kept), not provably optimal; no
  offcut reuse across materials, no "use my leftover pieces first".
- Solid wood assumes one board width per material (the narrowest standard width holding the
  widest part); real hardwood comes in random widths.
- Parts are named by their group's name; rename in Entity Info (the Outliner can't rename yet).
- The cut sheet is a web page printed from the browser (or saved as PDF there), not a PDF
  written directly; no labels/stickers per part.

## Materials
- No textures (color only): grain shows as an arrow on the selected part, not in the wood.
- **Material collections** (like SketchUp's): save materials into named collections, browse
  them across drawings, and import/export them. Today the library is built in and fixed.
- No veneer or edge-banding material types (OpenCutList has both), no density or price for
  estimates, no length/width/thickness oversize allowances.
- Solid wood picks the thinnest standard thickness at least as thick as the part (planed
  down); a part thinner than the thinnest stock still comes from it, without a warning.
- Paint Bucket: a click paints the whole object (deliberately unlike SketchUp's one face; Ctrl
  paints one face). No Shift (replace everywhere) variant.
- Painted color shows on both sides of a face; SketchUp paints front and back separately.
- Drawings saved before 5/4 and 6x lumber sizes were added keep their lumber materials' old size
  lists (add the sizes in the Materials panel, or re-add the material from the library).

## Tags
- Only groups and components can be tagged; loose geometry is always Untagged.
- No tag colors or "color by tag", dashed tag lines, or an "active tag" that new groups get
  automatically.
- Hidden groups are still listed in the Outliner (dimmed) but can't be selected there.
- Toggling a tag's visibility is an undo step (SketchUp does the same).

## Files
- **Import COLLADA (.dae) and OBJ**: open formats SketchUp (including the free SketchUp Make 2017)
  and most 3D programs export, with groups, components, names and materials (DAE) or named groups
  and an MTL of colors (OBJ). A way in for models from SketchUp 2020 and older, and other apps.
- File dialogs block the window while open (rfd's synchronous API).
- Export: OBJ (+ MTL colors) and ASCII STL only; no glTF, DAE or DXF/SVG (2D for CNC), no
  textures, no "export selection only", and each part isn't a separate STL file.

## UI
- Eraser: no Shift (hide) or Ctrl (soften/smooth) variants; it can't erase a face by itself (select it
  and press Delete).
- Layout follows SketchUp's Windows defaults (menu bar, toolbar, Large Tool Set, Default Tray,
  Measurements at bottom right), but toolbars can't be moved or customized and tray panels
  can't be reordered or undocked. No Components, Styles or Scenes panels yet.
- No right-click context menus (SketchUp's Entity menu: Make Group, Explode, Reverse Faces...).
- Standard views: Iso, Top, Front and Right only (no Back, Left, Bottom); no Parallel
  Projection toggle; tool cursors are the system arrow rather than per-tool icons.
- Sky and ground colors are fixed (SketchUp's Styles panel edits them).
- Keyboard focus never stays on buttons (it would swallow shortcuts and re-press the button
  on Space/Enter), so Tab-navigation between widgets isn't available.

## Rotate / grips
- Grips also appear around loose connected geometry (SketchUp shows them only on groups and
  components). Kept for now since it helps; revisit if it gets in the way.
- Grips on thin boards crowd together; consider hiding grips on faces that are tiny on screen.
- The protractor doesn't auto-orient to edges (SketchUp aligns to the hovered edge's plane)
  or flip when looking at it edge-on.

## Tools
- Not yet: Polygon, Follow Me, Dimensions, Text, Protractor, Section Plane, Walk/Look Around.
- Push/Pull: no Ctrl to keep the original face (push/pull copy), no double-click repeat
  across tools.
- Typing before the first click (e.g. absolute `[x,y,z]` start points).

## Rendering / UI
- Edges are 1px wide; tool previews and highlights are drawn on top without depth (x-ray).
- No hover pre-selection highlight in Select.
- Measurements show fractional inches only; no unit preferences (architectural, metric).
- Faces drawn on the ground face up, where SketchUp shows the blue back face (deliberate).

## Performance
Measured with `tests/perf.rs` (`cargo test --release -p woodsketch-ui-egui --test perf --
--ignored --nocapture`, `PERF_BOARDS=1500` for a big drawing). At 1500 boards (12,900 faces):
hover 1-3 ms, click 9 ms, selection highlight 2 ms, an edit 14-17 ms. A 729,000-face SketchUp
deck: opens in 0.3 s, first frame 0.06 s, a frame after an edit 0.03 s (drawing is instanced).
- Each edit still clones the scene for undo and re-flattens the whole view for picking (about
  0.1 s on the deck); sharing unchanged definitions (Arc) and per-definition caches would cut both.
- Selecting a huge group builds its highlight face by face.
- Picking tests every face's plane and box (cached per model), but has no spatial index; a BVH
  would make it constant-ish for very big models.
- Vertex dedupe (`add_vertex`) and edge lookup are linear scans per call (file import avoids them).
- Copies scaled unevenly are shaded with slightly off normals (the placement's matrix is used as is).

## Testing / infra
- Two full test runs once died without a failing assertion, likely a GPU driver crash with
  several wgpu devices at once. UI tests now take turns on the GPU; watch for recurrences.
