# WoodSketch

**Design it the way you already know.** WoodSketch is a free, open-source 3D modeler for
woodworkers. It works the way SketchUp does, but the parts know they're wood: species, grain,
real stock sizes, joinery, cut lists and build sheets.

## Download

WoodSketch is in **beta**. Installers for Windows, macOS (Apple silicon and Intel) and Linux are
on [woodsketch.net](https://woodsketch.net/#get-started) and in
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FMastro/woodsketch/releases/latest). Installed copies check
for updates when they start and install them when you restart.

The Windows installer is signed, though SmartScreen may still warn until the signature earns a
reputation: click *More info*, then *Run anyway*. The macOS installer isn't signed yet, so
right-click it and choose *Open*.

## What it does

- **Feels like SketchUp.** Select, Line, Rectangle, Circle, Arc, Push/Pull, Offset, Move,
  Rotate, Scale, Tape Measure, Eraser and Paint Bucket, with the same shortcuts. Type sizes
  into the Measurements box as you go (`3/4"`, `2'6`, `38mm`). Inference and snapping work the
  same way.
- **Groups, components and tags**, an Outliner, copy and paste, and arrays (`3x`, `/3`).
- **Boards from real stock.** Pick a material and a standard size (a 2x4, 3/4" plywood, 4/4
  cherry) and drag it out.
- **Templates.** A cabinet, drawer, face frame or table from a few sizes, with its joinery done.
- **Joinery.** Dados and rabbets, mortise and tenon (haunched, through), dowels, biscuits,
  loose tenons, pocket screws, half-laps, box joints, dovetails and splines, cut into the parts
  and listed with them.
- **Edge profiles.** Roundover, chamfer, cove and ogee.
- **Cut list and cutting diagrams.** Parts grouped by material and size, packed onto sheets
  and boards with kerf and grain direction, a shopping list, and glue-ups for wide panels.
- **Build sheets.** One printable page per part with views to scale and the steps in shop
  order.
- **Wood movement checks.** Warns where a part will swell or shrink across its grain against
  a part that won't move with it.
- **Works with your AI assistant.** `woodsketch-cli` (installed with the app) builds a drawing
  from a project recipe (JSON) and writes the cut list, cut sheet, build sheets, movement check
  and pictures; `woodsketch-cli mcp` is an MCP server for Claude and other agents. See
  [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md).
- **Save, autosave and export.** `.woodsketch` files, crash recovery, OBJ and STL export.

## Build from source

WoodSketch is written in Rust (egui and wgpu).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FMastro/woodsketch
cd woodsketch
cargo run --release -p woodsketch
```

On Linux, first install the windowing and file-dialog libraries, for example on Ubuntu:
`sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libx11-xcb-dev`.

Run the tests with `cargo test --workspace`. `CLAUDE.md` describes how the code is laid out,
and `docs/BACKLOG.md` lists what's planned.
